# Project Cartographer
This code is intended to simulate XLive libaries over System Link for Halo 2 Vista.

## CONTRIBUTE / SOURCE
Maybe you want to help out.
Maybe you’re just curious and wanna take a look at the code.

## Compiling / Requirements

Currently there’s a few different libraries required to actually get the source to compile…
Currently with the latest commit things should just compile with little to no complications so long as you have Direct X June 2010 SDK and the library/include paths for such setup correctly.
